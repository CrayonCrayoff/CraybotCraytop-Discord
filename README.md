CraybotCraytop is my custom Discord bot. It's very much a work in progress. 
I do intend to add to it over time, but right now, it just has 
some simple slash commands and a message listener.

Craybot doesn't really have any specific function or focus, I'm just going 
to add to it whatever functionality I'd like to use (if I think I can pull 
it off).

Right now, it makes extensive use of environment variables (as you can see 
in the code), which means the listener Cog essentially has hard-coded 
functionality.
